# Migration state

Updated: 2026-09-12T23:35:06.893Z

Control branch: `checkpoint/migration-control`.
Procedure: [MIGRATION-WORKFLOW.md](MIGRATION-WORKFLOW.md).
This file records durable state; it does not declare the entire migration accepted.

## Last durable implementation base

Repository: `mashimashica/eval-harness`.

Base commit: `d5ce0c10162cad788a17cb90f34b8f60574e7f75`.
Base tree: `354943ebbb8ea81a30523bfdc12baf26771853b5`.

The control branch starts from that implementation base. Its operating documents are separate from implementation
acceptance. No new evaluator, executor, runner, or compatibility path is introduced by this checkpoint.

| Slice | Draft PR | Verified head | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | [#38][pr38] | `b0d4229f49c7cc2441efd0f3aa929b58a9096c55` | CI passed |
| 02a | [#39][pr39] | `86b03a910799ecf97b33d3dac230c069a44bde65` | CI passed |
| 02b | [#40][pr40] | `0b3f41a0edcfffc1b6f4b537bcb2cab2e55e39c4` | CI passed |
| 03 | [#41][pr41] | `d5ce0c10162cad788a17cb90f34b8f60574e7f75` | CI passed |

PR heads, open state, and Draft state were read back while creating this record.
All four PRs remain unmerged. The stack is 01 -> 02a -> 02b -> 03.
PR02c has not been published. The migration still uses the original eleven logical slices, with PR02 split.

## Preserved validation for PR03

[Eval Harness CI run 34716101531][ci03] passed.

- 515 harness unit tests and all six shell integrations passed.
- Additional suites of 45 and 5 tests passed.
- Coverage: 9,854 of 10,210 statements, or 96.513222%. The exact 96% integer gate passed.
- Ruff, strict mypy, dependency audit, copyright, and secret checks passed.
- Tested synthetic merge: `7eae33620cc25715d2f97f96ee3fb33cfced093a`.
  Its tree was verified equal to the implementation base tree above.

These results apply to the recorded PR03 source. They do not establish final migration acceptance.
Real-model experiments have not been run.

## Unpublished work requires recovery

The previous execution environment became unavailable. After reconnection, the expected scratch directories,
including source stages and interface-contract files, were absent.
No usable remote implementation checkpoint for the unpublished slices has been identified.

| Slice | Earlier activity | Current recoverable state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 02c | Generation handoff implementation and focused validation | Source recovery and full validation required |
| 04 | Grader isolation implementation and boundary tests | Source recovery, security fixes, native CI required |
| 05 | Pure evaluator/planner implementation and focused validation | Source recovery and CLI integration required |
| 06 | Pure rubric/pairwise/panel logic and focused validation | Source recovery and common-path integration required |
| 07 | Stirrup generation separation and partial validation | Source recovery and shared HTTP integration required |
| 08 | AA-v2 profile/aggregation logic and partial validation | Source recovery and full integration required |
| 09 | Design and implementation contract | Exact contract recovery required; implementation not completed |
| 10-11 | No completed implementation recorded | Old-route deletion, documents, extension test, final acceptance remain |

Earlier focused test reports are historical observations, not proof of currently available source.
Do not mark these slices restored or validated until their actual bytes are recovered and checked.

## Required inputs before restarting implementation

Original user plan: `eval-harness-neutrality-migration-plan-2026-09-12.md`.
The user-provided canonical plan remains the scope authority.
Its local attachment copy is absent and its full text is not included in this checkpoint.
Do not substitute this state summary for that plan or for the exact interface contracts.

Next actions, in order:

1. Recover the original plan through an authorized source and save its exact bytes with provenance.
2. Recover any exact unpublished contracts/source that remain available; explicitly identify what needs rebuilding.
3. Create `checkpoint/pr-02c` from the durable implementation base above.
   Save the PR02c contract, scope, owner, and recovery record before changing code.
4. Implement or restore PR02c in small saved batches, then perform source review and all required validation.
5. Advance the migration stack one accepted implementation slice at a time.

Current implementation work in progress: none. Recovery of the plan/contracts is the next prerequisite.
Do not recreate all unpublished slices in parallel.

## Updating this control record

For each slice, record the reachable checkpoint branch and commit, saved contract paths, tested commit,
validation evidence, acceptance state, blocker, and next action.
Update after each saved code checkpoint, handoff, promotion, and validation result.
Keep implementation checkpoints self-describing even if this central record has not yet been updated.
